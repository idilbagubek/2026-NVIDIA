1. Energy Function:
Why: Because it is the very core of this project. If there is a error in the energy function, probably everyting is calculated wrong.

2. Flip Function:
Why: It is being used in Tabu Search and very core function.

3. Combine and Mutate Functions:
Why: They decide the MTS function to be more/less optimizing.

4. Bitstring To Spin Function:
Why: It decides what input goes into MTS.

4. Get Interaction Function:
Why: Interaction terms define the QAOA Hamiltonian - wrong terms = wrong optimization.

5. End To End Tests
